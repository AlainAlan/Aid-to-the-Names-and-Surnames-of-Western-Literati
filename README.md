## Chinese Names of Western Scholars & Western Names of Chinese Scholars

Just too lazy to write an En version.

> This listing aims to facilitate communication between Western and Asian China-scholars. As anyone who has attended a bi- or multilingual conference can attest, some amount of confusion is occasioned by the fact that Western sinologists are usually known in Chinese-speaking academia primarily by their Chinese names. As the latter, however, are not in common use in Western academic circles, it often takes a while to figure out that, for example, the professor Du Zanqi 杜贊奇, whom a Chinese conference participant keeps citing, is in fact better known in the English-speaking world as Prasenjit Duara.<br>

目标一致，只不过想：
1. 著录更加详细
2. 注重可迁移性
3. 冷嘲国家队
